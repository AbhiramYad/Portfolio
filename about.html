        <p>
            I’m a passionate Full Stack Developer with a strong focus on creating efficient, scalable, and user-friendly
            web applications. I enjoy transforming complex ideas into elegant digital solutions that balance
            functionality and design. With a solid foundation in both frontend and backend technologies, I’m comfortable
            taking projects from concept to deployment.

            I love staying current with new technologies and frameworks, and I continuously strive to write clean,
            maintainable, and well-documented code. Collaboration, problem-solving, and continuous learning drive my
            approach to development.
