                <p>Closed-circuit television (CCTV), also known as video surveillance,[1][2] is the use of
                    closed-circuit television cameras to transmit a signal to a specific place on a limited set of
                    monitors. It differs from broadcast television in that the signal is not openly transmitted, though
                    it may employ point-to-point, point-to-multipoint (P2MP), or mesh wired or wireless links. Even
                    though almost all video cameras fit this definition, the term is most often applied to those used
                    for surveillance in areas that require additional security or ongoing monitoring (videotelephony is
                    seldom called "CCTV". </p>

                <p>Fire extinguishers are essential safety tools for schools, and for them to be effective, they must be
                    the right type for different hazards, strategically placed, regularly inspected, and staff/students
                    must be trained to use them. Common types include ABC (for general use, flammable liquids, and
                    electrical fires), water mist (for sensitive equipment), and water (for solid materials). </p>

                    <p>Art and craft are creative activities involving making things with one's hands, often with the
                        goal of expression or creating something functional or decorative. While the terms are often
                        used together, "craft" generally focuses on skill to achieve a specific, pre-determined outcome,
                        while "art" is more about open-ended expression, process, and emotional impact. A wide variety
                        of materials like paper, paint, fabric, and clay can be used, and these activities can be a
                        hobby or a historical movement.
